RCP-Gifts-Through-EDD
=====================

An add-on plugin for Restrict Content Pro and Easy Digital Downloads that allows customers to purchase gift certificates (coupons) for RCP through EDD.

== 1. Activate Restrict Content Pro and Easy Digital Downloads ==

Both [Restrict Content Pro](http://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/) and [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com) are required for this plugin to function.

== 2. Create an EDD Product ==

Membership gifts are purchased through EDD as a standard download product. Create the product and setup all standard product details (price, categories, image, etc) and then check the box at that says _Enable RCP Gift creation for this product_. With that option checked, the product will be considered a "gift".

== 3. The Customer Flow ==

Customers wishing to purchase a membership gift will purchase the EDD product created in 2. When a gift product is added to the cart, additional fields will be added to the checkout screen:

- Gift Recipient's Name
- Gift Recipient's Email
- Message to Gift Recipient
- Send Gift to Recipient via Email

The first three fields are pretty self explanatory. The last option, shown as a checkbox, allows the customer to decide whether they wish to send the gift to the recipient via email. If they opt to send it, an email with the details of the gift will be sent to the recipient.

The gift is created as a unique coupon code in Restrict Content Pro and set to a 100% discount. The gift's recipient simply visits the RCP registration page, enters their details and the coupon code for a free membership.
